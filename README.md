# XenoWorld

A Luanti game for Luanti 5.12.0.

Some introduction and design note here.

- [Design Principle](./DesignPrinciple.md)

## About Materials

- wood: just a stone and wood era, no pure wood era. Reproducible, soft, resilient. Axe.
- stone: Cheap, not reproducible, hard, fragile. Pickaxe.
- metal: smelt to reshape
  - gold: noble metal
  - silver: noble metal
  - copper: noble metal, electric-related
  - iron: structure metal, tool metal
  - bronze: alloy
  - steel: alloy
- coal: burn
- ice: as a replacement of water

## Block Drops

Destroy a block will not drop them self. For machine, you can uninstall them.

## Fluid

Not like water or lava in Minecraft or Minetest. Maybe dwarf-fortress-like.
